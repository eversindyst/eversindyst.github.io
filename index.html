				<span style="position:relative;left:80px;width:1050px;display:block">As you kill enemies and gain XP you will eventually <span style="color:#01FF00">Level Up</span>. You start with 1 talent point and upon leveling up you will be awarded an additional talent point.
				This is indicated by a red + button showing up beside the "SKILL" button on the right. Clicking this button will bring up a talent tree menu where you can select from your available talents.
				These increase base stats by a fixed amount and will help you throughout your journey. Initially there are 3 lines of upgrades to select from. Each line has 65 total choices. Every 5 choices will be a 
				stronger than normal upgrade. Once all choices have been made in an upgrade line, that line will go away.

				<summary style="margin-left:50px;">Skills and Spells</summary>
				<span style="position:relative;left:80px;width:1050px;display:block">Skills and Spells are gained while leveling up. Each class has a different list of spells and skills available to it.
				In general Warrior and Rogue classes will use Skills, while Mage and Monk classes use Spells. Skills cost <span style="color:#204FAF">Stamina</span> and Spells cost <span style="color:#204FAF">Mana</span>. 
				However, they both work the same way. By clicking the "SKILL" button the skill/spell menu will show up. The bottom section will show the skills and spells available to your character. By clicking
				on one of them, they will be equipped, if there is an open slot. Only 3 skills/spells may be equipped at a time.<br><br>
				Spells and Skills have a % chance to activate during combat. This chance will typically increase as the skill/spell levels up. By clicking the "MOD" button next to a equipped skill/spell, the Mod menu will come up.
				Inside the mod menu you will be able to level up the skill/spell by clicking the "Level Up" text. This will have an increasing cost of <span style="color:#C5C5C5">Platinum</span>. Skills and Spells have a level
				limit of 20. Also on the Mod menu are 4 boxes that can be used to modify the skill/spell. Initially they are locked and can be unlocked with <span style="color:#C5C5C5">Platinum</span>. Once a mod box is unlocked 
				it will display a list of Modifications that can be applied. Hovering over a Mod will reveal more details about it and clicking a Mod will equip it. Clicking an equipped Mod will remove it.

				items it can drop at once, along with which items and how rare those items are. Equipment can be worn or removed from the "GEAR" menu. Clicking an item in your inventory will
				equip the item. Clicking an item that's equipped will remove the item.<br> Hovering over an item will show you the slot
				that the item goes in along with its stats. When you collect a duplicate of an item, the duplicate will be destroyed and grant some XP to the original version of the item. Once 
				the original reaches 100 XP it will <span style="color:#01FF00">Level Up</span> into a stronger version of itself. When an item reaches level 5 it will transform into a new more powerful item.<br><br>
				Your inventory can be sorted in Alphabetical order, by the slot type, or by the level of the items. You can also click the "SELL" button to enter sell mode. While in sell mode
				clicking an item in your inventory will sell it. Items are worth 0 <span style="color:#C5C5C5">Platinum</span>. If you reacquire a sold item it will retain its previous experience and level.

						Rogue: The Rogue class has strong basic attacks but relies on skills to make it through life. The Rogue starts with +1 to <span style="color:grey">Dexterity</span> and +3 to <span style="color:grey">Agility</span>.<br>
						Mage: The Mage class has very low basic damage but makes up for this with a powerful and vast arsenal of spells. The Mage starts with +4 to <span style="color:grey">Intelligence</span>.<br>
